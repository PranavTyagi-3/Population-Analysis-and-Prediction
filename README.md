# Population Data Analysis Web Application

This is a Flask-based web application for analyzing and visualizing population data from various sources. It provides insights into global and country-specific population trends, growth rates, and more. The application uses various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as Pandas, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Flask
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Scikit-Learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask pandas plotly scikit-learn
```

## Data Sources

The application uses the following data sources:

1. `world_population.csv`: A dataset containing global population data by country for various years.

2. `population_total_long.csv`: A dataset with global population data for different years.

3. `indian_population_new.csv`: Indian population data for various years.

4. `new.csv`: Data on urban population by continent.

5. `indian_population_new.csv`: Indian population data for various years.

## Functionality

The web application offers the following features:

- Visualization of global population trends over the years, including a prediction for future population.

- Analysis of the population of the top 15 countries.

- Visualization of population density by country.

- Visualization of population by continent.

- Analysis of India's population growth and related metrics, including urban vs. rural population, infant mortality rate, birth rate, and death rate.

- Correlation matrix for various features related to India's population.

- Country-specific population prediction based on historical data and growth rate.

- Visualization of urban population percentage by country.

- Visualization of continent-wise population growth rates.

- Visualization of continent-wise total population.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed, as mentioned in the prerequisites.

3. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory containing the `app.py` file.
